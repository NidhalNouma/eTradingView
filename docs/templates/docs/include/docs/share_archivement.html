        Share properties & perfermance
      </h3>

      <p>
        The easiest way to share the properties and performance you used is by exporting the data from the TradingView strategy tester as an Excel file.<br />
        To do this, open the strategy tester, click on the strategy name, and select ‘Export Data.’ <br />
        The video below demonstrates this process. While you can manually enter the details, we highly recommend using the exported file for accuracy and convenience.
