      Share inputs & properties
    </h1>

    <p>
      The easiest way to share the inputs and properties you used is by
      downloading the properties file from the TradingView strategy tester.
      The video below demonstrates how you can do this. While you can add them
      manually, we highly recommend using the downloaded file for convenience.
