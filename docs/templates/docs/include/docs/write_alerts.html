        <h1>Alerts</h1>
  
        <p>
          Each strategy will come with a minimum of four built-in alerts, designed
          for both entry and exit signals. These alerts serve the dual purpose of
          keeping you informed about every action the strategy takes and enabling
          automation if you wish to implement alert-based automation.

        <h1>Placeholders</h1>
  
        <p>
          These placeholders can be used in the alert message, and they will be
          replaced with dynamic values when the alert is triggered. They are the
          sole method for including dynamic values that can vary from bar to bar.
          <br/>The placeholders need to be enclosed within double curly braces. Below are the placeholders you can use:
        </p>
  
        <div>
          {% include "include/docs/alert_placeholder.html" with placeholder="{{type}}" description='The type of action can be either Entry, Exit, Stop Loss (SL) hit, Take Profit (TP) hit, hard close, or x candle close.' %}

          {% include "include/docs/alert_placeholder.html" with placeholder="{{current_price}}" description='The current price' %}

          {% include "include/docs/alert_placeholder.html" with placeholder="{{TP2}}" description='The take profit 2 in pips/points.' %}
          {% include "include/docs/alert_placeholder.html" with placeholder="{{TP3}}" description='The take profit 3 in pips/points.' %}
  
          {% include "include/docs/alert_placeholder.html" with placeholder="{{exchange}}" description='Exchange of the symbol used in the alert (NASDAQ, NYSE, MOEX, etc.). Note that for delayed symbols, the exchange will end with “_DL” or “_DLY.” For example, “NYMEX_DL.”' %}
          {% include "include/docs/alert_placeholder.html" with placeholder="{{interval}}" description='Returns the timeframe of the chart the alert is created on. Note that Range charts are calculated based on 1m data, so the placeholder will always return “1” on any alert created on a Range chart.' %}
          {% include "include/docs/alert_placeholder.html" with placeholder="{{open}}, {{high}}, {{low}}, {{close}}, {{volume}}" description='Corresponding values of the bar on which the alert has been triggered.' %}
          {% include "include/docs/alert_placeholder.html" with placeholder="{{time}}" description='Returns the time at the beginning of the bar. Time is UTC, formatted as yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ, so for example: 2019-08-27T09:56:00Z.' %}
          {% include "include/docs/alert_placeholder.html" with placeholder="{{timenow}}" description=' Current time when the alert triggers, formatted in the same way as {{time}}. The precision is to the nearest second, regardless of the chart’s timeframe.' %}

          <span >After setting up the alert message on the strategy you're using,</span> to start receiving alert messages on TradingView, you'll need to add one. With our strategies, you'll only need to create one, and it will send alerts on any entry as well as on any exit, one alert per strategy. <br/>The video below will show you how to add one.
