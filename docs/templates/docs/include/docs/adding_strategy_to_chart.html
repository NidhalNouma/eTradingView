            Now that you have access to our strategies, the easiest way to use them
            is by clicking on the strategy you want to work with. After selecting
            the strategy, it will take a few seconds to load, and then you will see
            it on the chart.
            <br />Each strategy will have a list of properties that you can adjust,
            and you will see the results changing in real-time.

            We also offer some manual trend strategies that require you to manually
            select the time and price points to determine where to draw the
            trendline.
            <br />The video below provides instructions on how to do this.
