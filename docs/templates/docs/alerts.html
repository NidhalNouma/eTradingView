      <p class="mt-2 text-base">
        Each strategy will come with a minimum of four built-in alerts, designed
        for both entry and exit signals. These alerts serve the dual purpose of
        keeping you informed about every action the strategy takes and enabling
        automation if you wish to implement alert-based automation.

      <p class="mt-2 text-base">
        These placeholders can be used in the alert message, and they will be
        replaced with dynamic values when the alert is triggered. They are the
        sole method for including dynamic values that can vary from bar to bar.
        <br/>The placeholders need to be enclosed within double curly braces. Below are the placeholders you can use:
